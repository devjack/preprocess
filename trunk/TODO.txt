# High Priority

- code repo:
    - checkin the state before this patch to google code
    - branch to branches/1.0.x
    - rev to 1.1.0 with these changes and hans.txt stuff and do a new release
- hans.txt:
    Makefile.py
    mk test (see hans' patches)
        - checkin
        - move content.types *inside* preprocess.py, still have support for
          a prepended content.types:
            - look in dirname(__file__)
            - add an option for a content.types
          Update docs for this
        - support Python 2.3? If so, fix that in 'test' task
    setup.py
    googlecode release
    pypi release
    trentm.com update
- switch to testlib.py
- move BUGS.txt to issues on code site
- move to 1.0.x branch and start preprocess 2: if can justify the change for:
    - string inter syntax that doesn't suffer from accidents (though that
      creates a prob for maintain syntax validity in the document)
    - stricter syntax to avoid accidental ##if
- add issues for everything important here
- add issue from Mike Bauer:
    Yes, that is a problem that I occassionally ran into, but mostly just hacked around because I didn't think it would be that common.

    To "fix" this, I think I want to get strict about the preprocess.py directive by requiring no space between the second "#" and the directive name:

        # #if ...     (this works)
        ##  if ...    (this is not treated as a preprocess.py directive)

- add logging_patch_from_alfred.patch
- use path_from_path_patterns recipe to provide a simple facility for
  recursively preprocessing a bunch of files, a dir, etc. As suggested by
  Hans.
- fix MANIFEST.in processing from picking up README.txt in .svn dirs
- need eolconverter recipe for building dists on Windows
- "build sdist" broken on Windows
- "build webdist" not implemented on Windows
- should I do dists for both kinds of EOLs???
- convert to logging package
- put up on cheeseshop


# Medium Priority

- A better longterm fix for 0.9.2's copying content.types to the "binDir"
  next to preprocess.py is to have the launcher stub NOT have the .py file
  next to it. We should only be placing one preprocess.py in the lib dir.
  Perhaps setuptools stub stuff can help here?
- test 'includePath' optional argument
- test cases for the module interface (do I have any?)
- test cases for -k|--keep-lines
- patchtemplate functionality: look at how the preprocessor.pl below does
  this, perhaps this is an acceptible poorman's version
  (Somewhat have this, see --substitute added in v0.6.0.)
- stealing from http://software.hixie.ch/utilities/unix/preprocessor/
    - Should I really add #elifdef and #elifndef?
    - Would #filter/#endfilter be useful?
- be more strict:
    - perhaps add -W<arg> option to allow levels of strictness
      - make #undef of undefined vars an error
- perhaps add #pragma to enable turning on of options: e.g.
    # #pragma substitution
